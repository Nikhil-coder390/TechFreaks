### Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunication Industry

## Brief Project Description
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the Telecommunication industry. Given the high demand and frequent switching of services by customers, retaining them becomes crucial for companies to save marketing costs and increase EBITDA. The project aims to build a model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not and assist the Marketing as well as Alarming team of these big firms.

## Methodology
1. Collected a vast Telecommunication dataset with significant imbalance.
2. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including categorical and numerical analysis.
3. Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
4. Mitigated overfitting and balanced the dataset.
5. Utilized various Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., to assess accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision.
6. Achieved a high accuracy of 98% in the final model.
7. Developed a backend model and designed a user-friendly front end for a simulated telecom company with diverse features.
8. Implemented a survey feature for customers to receive model predictions based on their responses, providing insights to marketing, sales, and alarm teams for proactive customer engagement and retention strategies.
